# Zombie Shooter

## Overview
"Zombie Shooter" is a top-down 2D shooter game developed as part of my CS50 final project. The game challenges players to survive waves of zombies using strategic movement and shooting mechanics.

This game reflects my programming skills and my ability to apply what I learned in CS50 to create a complete, functional project.

## Game Concept
The game revolves around:
- **Survival:** Avoid zombie hordes as they progressively become more challenging.
- **Focus on Movement and Shooting:** Navigate wisely and shoot accurately to eliminate zombies.
- **Wave-Based Progression:** Each wave increases in difficulty, requiring better strategy and precision.

## Features
- Smooth and precise movement mechanics (`movement.lua`).
- Dynamic shooting system (`shooting.lua`).
- Wave-based progression for increased difficulty.
- Minimalist design with no sound effects to respect cultural and religious values.

## Philosophy
The game reflects a unique design philosophy, focusing on visual feedback rather than audio effects. This choice was inspired by cultural and religious considerations, showing how creativity can thrive within ethical boundaries.
